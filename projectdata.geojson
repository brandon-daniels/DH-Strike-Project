On behalf of the District, I extend our appreciation both to the State Police and Lewisboro Police for their swift and effective work. While the media reported the arrests of three juveniles, we can confirm that the three are students in our schools. We are now working with these students and their families. As I wrote in my original email on this topic, we will never accept the appearance of symbols of hate in our schools. We will continue to educate all our students on the importance of tolerance, acceptance, and compassion. Behavior that is hurtful to others has no place in our school community. Some may want to ask what consequences the District provides for students who commit such acts. Specific consequences, however, that are given to individual students remain confidential. The community can be assured that such matters are taken very seriously. Within the last few days, school principals and I met with local religious leaders to discuss how we can best work together to support the students and the community we collectively serve. We plan to keep these lines of communication open moving forward. As always, my thanks to our community for your support. Sincerely, Andrew Selesnick Superintendent of Schools", "notes": null, "Actor": "school administration", "Move": "letters\/statements", "Actor_1": "police\/sheriff", "Move_1": "suspension\/denial of acces to space", "Actor_2": "school administration", "Move_2": "policy\/committe\/system creation", "Actor_3": "religious leaders", "Move_3": "victim support", "Accuracy Score": 0.0, "Accuracy Type": null, "Number": null, "Street": null, "Unit Type": null, "Unit Number": null, "City_1": null, "State_1": null, "County": null, "Zip": null, "Country": null, "Source": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -73.555742, 41.276199 ] } },

Text of letter: Dear UIndy Students: Respect, faith, empiricism, and the celebration of intellectual and human diversity create the core traditions of the University of Indianapolis. During the past three years, our community has discussed the themes of race and ethnicity, religious freedom and liberties, social justice and human rights – areas profoundly impacting our nation and most recently, the public policies of our state. As our colleagues at Purdue, IU, Cornell, University of Missouri, Yale, and many other institutions around the country engage these questions, we are all reminded how these debates are central to understanding the role that higher education plays in the construction of a civil and educated society. I am proud of our tradition of respectfully and openly engaging in discussions about the most critical issues of our time. We have engaged questions of same-sex marriage, our students recently debated the questions of the Israeli and Palestinian conflict and human rights, and we have been in ongoing conversations about race and culture with all of our members. In direct contrast to our efforts to celebrate our diversity, I was recently made aware that someone scratched a swastika on the bust of Au Ho-nien, located in Schwitzer Student Center. The incident is currently under investigation. Such an act is against every core value on which our University stands; yet it reminds us we are not immune to intolerance and hate. UIndy has not and will never tolerate such behavior. Our University community is created by and comprised of people from many different views, experiences, cultures and beliefs. We are a great institution of higher education because of our diversity – and must do everything we can to continue to value this reality. Later this week I will receive the outcomes of our second campus climate survey as well as recommendations from the Diversity and Inclusion Task Force. For the past six months, I have also been in conversations with our University Planning Commission and student groups around campus. Having been privileged to see a preview of these findings, I am empowering our university leadership to accelerate the implementation of many of the recommendations from these groups – most prominently, the creation of a position at UIndy to engage questions of diversity and inclusion on campus. I am proud of our University’s longstanding tradition of engaging conversations about difficult societal issues and creating change. This is a moment for UIndy to continue its work in this area, and I am confident that together we are prepared for this challenge.", "notes": null, "Actor": "school administration", "Move": "letters\/statements", "Actor_1": "school administration", "Move_1": "policy\/committe\/system creation", "Actor_2": null, "Move_2": null, "Actor_3": null, "Move_3": null, "Accuracy Score": 0.8, "Accuracy Type": "place", "Number": null, "Street": null, "Unit Type": null, "Unit Number": null, "City_1": "Indianapolis", "State_1": "IA", "County": "Mahaska County", "Zip": 50268, "Country": "US", "Source": "TIGER\/Line® dataset from the US Census Bureau" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -92.43352, 41.396952 ] } },

From the bottom of my heart I can tell you that that is not the way of my Jamaican heritage. My Jamaican West Indian extended family are strict disciplinarians who have always taught me to embrace diversity and cultural differences. They taught me to be respectful to all no matter what the circumstances are. Before my dad and I moved to Arizona seven years ago, we lived in a town called Queens in New York City where I was born. While I lived in New York I got to interact with many different cultures and people. I embrace that teaching and that has helped me to develop friendship with a diverse group of people. I have friends from many different backgrounds and cultures. Last December during the holiday season I made a mistake when I joined my friends in a very insensitive prank. If I could turn back the clock and remove myself and my three friends from participating in the horrible prank I would. But I canâ€™t. My dad said that if there is a silver lining in this very dark cloud it is that I have become much more aware of the Jewish culture and I now have a better understanding of the Menorah and what it means. Over the last couple of days my dad who attended the Jewish-based Brandeis University in Boston gave me a text book lesson on the Jewish culture and what Judaism is. To the family affected by the horrible prank I once again express regret and ask you to forgive me. I ask you for a second chance and for the opportunity to complete my college education and get a chance to live a better life and be a good citizen. Clive (CJ) Wilson Police helped Naomi and Seth Ellis dismantle the swastika early in the morning before the Ellis children saw it. The menorah was rebuilt and replaced. About 100 members of the family’s synagogue and their rabbi and neighbors gathered in the Ellis front yard to light the rebuilt menorah. They were sentenced to serve 30 hours of community service, along with writing an apology letter to the victims and paying restitution. They also must meet with a Holocaust survivor and write an essay on what they learn about the Holocaust and how their desecration of the menorah affected the community, the CBS affiliate in Phoenix reported.", "notes": "teen twisted large menorah in yard into swastika", "Actor": "police\/sheriff", "Move": "clean up\/cover up", "Actor_1": "community members", "Move_1": "gathering\/protest\/vigil\/demonstration", "Actor_2": "police\/sheriff", "Move_2": "suspension\/denial of acces to space", "Actor_3": "community members", "Move_3": "other", "Accuracy Score": 1.0, "Accuracy Type": "place", "Number": null, "Street": null, "Unit Type": null, "Unit Number": null, "City_1": "Chandler", "State_1": "AZ", "County": "Maricopa County", "Zip": 85224, "Country": "US", "Source": "TIGER\/Line® dataset from the US Census Bureau" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -111.878217, 33.324113 ] } },

Italics have been added for visual differentiation while a dotted line separates each message:\n \n KLSD reaffirms a climate of acceptance and inclusion for all\n \n Swastikas were discovered carved into a tree on the John Jay High School campus yesterday afternoon, just three weeks after a swastika was found on the playground of Lewisboro Elementary School.\n \n Lewisboro Police were immediately contacted and an investigation has begun by both the police and the high school administration. The State and Lewisboro Police have apprehended three students in conjunction with the graffiti at Lewisboro Elementary.\n \n “As a District, we are saddened and angered by the appearance of symbols of hatred in our community,” said Katonah-Lewisboro Superintendent Andrew Selesnick. “When events such as these occur, it is important first and foremost to shine a light immediately on what has occurred, to name it, and to condemn it.”\n \n Selesnick said the high school principal called students and staff together Friday morning to convey that same message, to assure that such behavior is not, and never will be, acceptable in the community, and to begin thinking about the most productive ways to move forward.\n \n “As an educational institution, we are always working to teach our students the lessons of history. We are always working to convey the expectation and the need for acceptance, compassion, and respect,” Selesnick said. “The events of the last few weeks cause us to reflect on where and how we can strengthen the work we are already doing. We have reached out to organizations outside the school because this work does not and should not belong to the schools alone. It is critical that we commit ourselves to educating and raising children as a community. These events serve as a reminder of the importance of our partnership.”\n \n Superintendent Selesnick declined to name the students apprehended in the first swastika incident, citing the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). FERPA prohibits the release of student records, including disciplinary records, without the consent of the student’s parent. He added, however, that the district’s Code of Conduct spells out a range of consequences up to suspension from school.\n \n “We are entrusted with the community’s children, and we take that responsibility seriously. Children are here to learn and sometimes their most challenging lessons occur outside the classroom,” Selesnick said.\n \n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n January 20, 2017\n \n Dear JJHS Community,\n \n This message is a follow up after informing the community of anti-Semitic graffiti found on the high school campus yesterday.\n \n First thing this morning, I called together our 9th and 10th graders, and our 11th and 12th graders, in two separate assemblies in order to speak with them in person about recent events. It is my hope that all of our families reflect on the day’s assemblies with their children this evening and assist us in our ongoing work.\n \n As part of the assemblies, students were informed about the discovery of swastikas on school grounds yesterday. A discussion about the pain such symbols of hate create for individuals and the community ensued. I’m gratified but not surprised to report our students knew exactly why such symbols have no place in our community. In addition to discussing why such acts are painful and intolerable everywhere in the Katonah-Lewisboro Schools and our society, we also focused on how our students have the agency, guidance, and support to turn this pain into a truer representation of who we are and what we stand for.\n \n The recently celebrated birthday of the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., gave us all context to explore his words of how only light can drive out darkness. His prophetic words also challenged all of us at the high school to find avenues to “turn on the light,” and we will work to do so.\n \n Our student body (and especially our student leaders) were called upon to partner with their peers, teachers, and administrators, to find ways to consciously and intentionally express and affirm our desire to be a culture where all are valued, respected, and belong.\n \n Thank you for your continued support in keeping all of our students safe and whole.\n \n Sincerely,\n \n Dr. Steven T.

We are confident that this swastika was recently created. Students alerted administration to the presence of the symbol in a library bathroom. For further detail, I have attached the notice sent by Dr. Siciliano. In my January 24th letter to the community, in which I provided information about how the school district is responding to the repeated instances of swastikas on school property, I said that I would soon provide an opportunity for dialogue. I am now extending that invitation to any and all members of our community who would like to join us in discussion. On Thursday, February 16th at 7:30 pm, we will provide a forum in the John Jay High School cafeteria. While there are steps that schools take to help students understand the meaning and impact of their actions, the work of inspiring empathy and combating hatred is work for a collective, connected community. My intention for our meeting on the 16th is to provide a space for dialogue, for the sharing of concerns and hopes, and for thinking together about moving forward. I hope this will be an opportunity for us to consider the many ways we inspire respect, empathy, and compassion, and I hope you will consider joining us. Sincerely, Andrew Selesnick February 8, 2017 Dear JJHS Community, With a deep sense of sadness, I must report another incident of a swastika at JJHS. This morning, students alerted administration to a swastika in a library bathroom. Once again, the police were notified immediately and have commenced their investigation. Once again, we must condemn the appearance of this hateful symbol in our school and continue the work that has already begun. A number of students have already exercised real leadership by planning events and programs to respond positively to prior incidents of anti-Semitic graffiti on campus and in the community. These plans include inviting Mrs. Judith Altmann, who is a Holocaust survivor, to speak to all of us later this month. We are also in contact with the Anti-Defamation League about possible programming for the future. Later today, Mr. Selesnick will be sending a letter to the entire community, inviting all to an open forum next Thursday, February 16th. When similar events happen in succession, we must consider the possibility that the root cause may be a misplaced need for attention and weigh our response accordingly. While certain responses are predictable (calling the police, condemning the act), other responses will vary. Please know that we are giving considerable thought and attention as to the best path forward for all our students. We continue to ask for the assistance and support of the student body and community. We are extremely grateful that students came to us immediately today. If anyone else has information related to this most recent act, please contact an administrator or the Lewisboro Police immediately. Be assured that we will continue working with our students, community, and police to help put a stop to these most disturbing acts. Thank you for your continued cooperation and assistance. Sincerely, Steven T.

Everyone belongs; everyone is welcome; and everyone deserves to feel safe and respected in our schools. As educators, we need to teach children what some words and symbols mean and how those words and symbols make other people feel. In our schools, students are members of an inclusive community that values respectful and responsible relationships. We need to teach students very explicitly and intentionally exactly what that means. Please let me know if you have any other questions, Jennifer Fischer-Mueller, Ed.D. Superintendent of Schools Here's the letter sent home from the principal: March 23, 2017 Dear Galvin Parents\/Guardians and Staff: Wednesday afternoon, two Swastikas were found in the 3rd floor of the boys' bathroom by an after-school custodian. This incident is extremely disturbing and against our school values of creating a welcoming, safe, and inclusive community at the Galvin Middle School. I want to assure the Galvin community that this incident, and any incident of intolerance to others, is taken very seriously. Galvin administrators, along with our School Resource Officer, are investigating this incident. Our guidance staff, along with school officials, will be available to offer support to students. In addition, over the coming days, our student body will have an opportunity to think about the important nature and implications of this type of incident in discussions they will have with some of their teachers. We will continue to educate and support your children so to insure that everyone is striving to create and sustain respectful and responsible relationships for all.

I am here to say that while hate may live in the hearts of some in our Community, we give it no shelter and no safe harbor.

The latter happened, leaving a nearly empty support section, which is an unusual sight for a Rising FC match. Afterward, Rising FC issued a statement saying the banner was asked to be removed “in order to comply with United Soccer League stadium regulations and Phoenix Rising Football Club safety policies.” The statement also said, “Phoenix Rising FC did not intend for our friends from Los Bandidos to leave our stadium, and apologize if our communications during the match did not properly demonstrate our respect and appreciation for its members. In fact, Phoenix Rising FC fully and unequivocally, supports the ‘Stop Racism’ sentiment of the banner and believes all people should be treated equally and with love. According to United Soccer League stadium guidelines, “All banners and signs must be inspected by security as fans enter the stadium, at least 30 minutes before kickoff. The club has the right to deny any banner’s display in the venue. Any sign or tifo deemed offensive, explicit, racist, homophobic or in bad taste will not be permitted in the venue.” In a Facebook post, Los Bandidos wrote, “We were never on bad terms with the ownership or (front office) ,we had a good standing with them before and now through direct discussion with the club- it’s brought us even closer.

The students then removed all the paint from the door. The student who painted the swastika reported to campus authorities what they had done. The college has begun disciplinary proceedings, and the student will be held accountable under our campus code of conduct. In addition, we will continue speaking directly with the students who were involved or immediately affected in the dorm where the painting occurred. None of the people directly involved felt targeted as a function of their identity. For that reason we instigated our investigation and conduct processes without initially making a larger campus announcement. However, several JAs have reported that other students who heard partial accounts of the incident were concerned, especially in the aftermath of Charlottesville and other troubling events. Understanding their concerns, we want you to have full information about what happened and know what steps are being taken, and to assure you that we have no basis for thinking the incident points to an ongoing threat. Defacing our campus is unacceptable at any time. But the use of a swastika, even as a “prank,” shows a lack of sensitivity to how that symbol has been used as a weapon of intimidation and hatred, both historically and in recent incidents around the country. If you want support, or if you have questions, please contact the Dean’s Office, the Office of Institutional Diversity & Equity our Chaplains, the Davis Center or Wellbeing Services. And if you have experienced an incident of bias or are aware of one, please report it immediately so the college can step in.", "notes": null, "Actor": "school administration", "Move": "letters\/statements", "Actor_1": "school administration", "Move_1": "suspension\/denial of acces to space", "Actor_2": "school administration", "Move_2": "victim support", "Actor_3": null, "Move_3": null, "Accuracy Score": 1.0, "Accuracy Type": "place", "Number": null, "Street": null, "Unit Type": null, "Unit Number": null, "City_1": "Williamstown", "State_1": "MA", "County": "Berkshire County", "Zip": 1267, "Country": "US", "Source": "TIGER\/Line® dataset from the US Census Bureau" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -73.257699, 42.642075 ] } },

The “W” in the center of our school was defaced with graffiti containing offensive symbols and language. Campus security and custodians responded immediately, covering the area to prevent students’ exposure. We have reported the crime to law enforcement and paint crews are on scene to try to repair the damage. While the investigation and cleanup is underway, it is important our community knows that this is NOT the Wolverine Way. The actions of this person or group of people do not reflect the pride we take in our campus and the safe learning environment that Westview High School and the Poway Unified School District strive to provide our students. Westview High School continues to be a place where all of our students are respected and are expected to respect one another. If you or your student has any information that might help the investigation, please contact my office immediately.

I am reaching out to our broader school community to both alert you to this news and to emphasize that symbols and messages of hate have no place in our schools and represent a clear violation of our Core Values. Moments like these also provide an opportunity for our entire community to speak with a unified voice in rejecting anti-Semitism and racism, as well as to affirm those values we stand for such as Respect for Human Differences and Building and Maintaining Cooperative and Caring Relationships. I ask that you consider conversations at home that reinforce these messages. Dr. Chisum has some excellent suggestions in his letter on how to approach this topic.
